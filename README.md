# Risk limits of pooled interpolator in transfer learning

This is the official repo for the paper [Generalization error of min-norm interpolators in transfer learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13944).

Two functions in main.R calculates the limiting asymptotic risks of the pooled interpolator under model shift and design shift, respectively.
